        "question": "What is Nostr?",
        "answer": "Nostr is a decentralized protocol for social networking. It uses cryptographic key pairs for identity, meaning you own your account without relying on any company. We use Nostr for verification because it aligns with Bitcoin's values of self-sovereignty."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does verification take?",
        "answer": "Email verification is instant once you enter the code. Domain verification depends on DNS propagation, typically 5-30 minutes, but can take up to 48 hours in some cases."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I verify multiple businesses?",
        "answer": "Yes, a single Nostr account can verify multiple businesses, as long as you can prove ownership of each one through email or domain verification."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why can't I use common email providers for domain verification?",
        "answer": "For domain verification via email, we only accept custom email domains (like you@yourbusiness.com). This ensures the verification actually proves domain ownership. However, if your venue has an email listed (even Gmail), you can still use email code verification."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is verification free?",
        "answer": "Yes, verification is completely free. We believe in open access to the Bitcoin economy."
