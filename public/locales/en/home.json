        "question": "What is MappingBitcoin?",
        "answer": "MappingBitcoin is the largest open-source directory of Bitcoin-accepting merchants worldwide. We aggregate data from OpenStreetMap and allow businesses to verify their listings using Nostr, a decentralized identity protocol."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I add my business to the map?",
        "answer": "You can add your business by clicking \"Add your business\" and filling out the form. Your listing will be submitted to OpenStreetMap, the world's largest open mapping project. Alternatively, you can add it directly on OpenStreetMap and it will appear on MappingBitcoin automatically."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is MappingBitcoin free to use?",
        "answer": "Yes, MappingBitcoin is completely free for both users and businesses. We believe in open access to the Bitcoin economy."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does it mean for a business to be \"verified\"?",
        "answer": "Verified businesses have cryptographically proven ownership of their listing through email or domain verification. This is linked to their Nostr identity, providing trust without relying on any central authority."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the data?",
        "answer": "Our data comes from OpenStreetMap, a community-maintained map. While we strive for accuracy, information can become outdated. We encourage users to report incorrect listings and businesses to verify their information."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you support Lightning Network?",
        "answer": "Yes! Many listed businesses accept Lightning payments. You can filter the map to show only Lightning-accepting venues. We also support on-chain Bitcoin payments."
