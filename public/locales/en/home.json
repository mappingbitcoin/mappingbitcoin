      {
        "question": "What is Mapping Bitcoin?",
        "answer": "Mapping Bitcoin is the largest open-source directory of Bitcoin-accepting merchants worldwide. We aggregate data from OpenStreetMap and allow businesses to verify their listings using Nostr, a decentralized identity protocol."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I add my business to the map?",
        "answer": "You can add your business by clicking \"Add your business\" and filling out the form. Your listing will be submitted to OpenStreetMap, the world's largest open mapping project. Alternatively, you can add it directly on OpenStreetMap and it will appear on Mapping Bitcoin automatically."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do reviews and ratings work?",
        "answer": "Reviews are published as Nostr events, making them decentralized and owned by you. Ratings are weighted by Web of Trust - reviews from trusted community members have more influence on aggregate scores than anonymous or new accounts. This provides Sybil-resistant ratings without centralized moderation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Web of Trust and why does it matter?",
        "answer": "Web of Trust (WoT) is a decentralized trust model based on your Nostr social graph. Trust flows through follow connections from community seeders. Reviews from people closer to your trust network are highlighted, and their ratings carry more weight. This helps filter spam and surface genuine community feedback."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a Nostr account to use Mapping Bitcoin?",
        "answer": "You can browse the map and view venues without an account. To leave reviews, rate venues, or verify your business, you'll need to log in with a Nostr identity. You can use a browser extension (Alby, nos2x), enter your private key directly, or use a Nostr Connect bunker."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does it mean for a business to be \"verified\"?",
        "answer": "Verified businesses have cryptographically proven ownership of their listing through email or domain verification. This is linked to their Nostr identity, providing trust without relying on any central authority. Verified owners can also respond to reviews on their venue."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Mapping Bitcoin free to use?",
        "answer": "Yes, Mapping Bitcoin is completely free for both users and businesses. We believe in open access to the Bitcoin economy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you support Lightning Network?",
        "answer": "Yes! Many listed businesses accept Lightning payments. You can filter the map to show only Lightning-accepting venues. We also support on-chain Bitcoin payments."
