MappingBitcoin.com is built on community contributions. Here's how you can help grow the Bitcoin merchant directory.

## Adding Venues

Help expand the directory by adding Bitcoin-accepting businesses you know about.

### How to Add a Venue

1. Navigate to the [map](/map)
2. Click **"Add Place"** button
3. Fill out the venue details:
   - Name and category
   - Location (use the map picker)
   - Payment methods accepted
   - Contact information
4. Submit the form

Your submission goes directly to OpenStreetMap, making it available to the entire OSM community.

### Requirements

- OpenStreetMap account (free to create)
- Accurate location information
- Verification that the business accepts Bitcoin

## Verifying Venues

If you own or operate a Bitcoin-accepting business, verify your listing to build trust.

### Verification Benefits

### Verification Methods

**Email Verification**

**Domain Verification**

- Proves ownership of the business website
- 24-hour window to complete

See the [Verification Guide](/docs/verification) for detailed instructions.

## Reviews & Ratings

Share your experiences at Bitcoin-accepting venues through our decentralized review system.

### Writing Reviews

1. Visit any venue page
2. Scroll to the Reviews section
3. Sign in with your Nostr account
4. Select a star rating (1-5)
5. Optionally add text and images
6. Submit your review

Your review is published as a Nostr event, making it portable and censorship-resistant.

### What Makes a Good Review

- Specific details about the payment experience
- Information about Lightning vs on-chain acceptance
- Staff knowledge about Bitcoin
- Any tips for other customers

### Trust-Weighted Ratings

Reviews are weighted by Web of Trust (WoT). Trusted community members have more impact on aggregate ratings than new or unknown accounts. This helps resist spam and fake reviews.

See [Reviews](/docs/reviews) for full documentation.

### For Business Owners

Verified venue owners can respond to reviews on their venues. See [Verification](/docs/verification) to claim your business.

## Reporting Issues

> **Coming Soon**

A reporting system is in development for:

- Flagging closed businesses
- Reporting incorrect information
- Marking venues that no longer accept Bitcoin
- Suggesting data corrections

In the meantime, you can edit venue information directly or [contact us](/contact) with corrections.
